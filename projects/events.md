# Participation

Participation is voluntary and no attempts will be made to force team members to compete, practice, or train. Opportunities will be available for members to share their experience and knowledge through a collaborative means such as Google Hangouts or central repositories such as Github. Outside of collaborative opportunities team members will conduct self-improvement in order to enhance the overall capabilities of the team.

# Practice

Practice sessions are not listed and will be distributed via the team's Google forum. In general all team practices will be the last Saturday of each month. Practices may also increase as we near events in order to divide skill sets, assign team leaders, assign responsibilities, and orient ourselves against past challenges.
