<strong>Description:</strong> Tokens was a python exploitation challenge during the 2016 Pwn2Win CTF competition held from 25-27 March. When solved the team was awarded 50 points. This challenge focused on being able to identify exploitable python code which would allow the competitor to take advantage of the running service. This challenge explored the vulnerability of misusing the python ```eval()``` method.

## Introduction

Tokens was a fairly straight-forward challenge based around secure programming practices and involved a minimal amount of reversing. We were given a little bit of information about the program using a fixed value for the seed, and the source code.

> Tokens
> Points: 50
> Category: Python Exploitation
> Description:
>We discovered a Club’s “homemade” token generator system which uses a fixed value as a seed (is it a joke?). Some Club systems use this token scheme, so we need to make a leak in order to compromise them. Due to a week-long effort, our hardcore newbie SkyMex was able to obtain the token generator source code from a private git repository before it received the official seed.
>Submit the flag in the format: CTF-BR{seed}.

## Problem

Initially, our thought was to brute force the keyspace for the seed, because we knew it should be of a limited size, and had an idea of what characters it would contain based on the ```gentoken()``` function which produced the token for us. However, after several hours of trying to brute force the seed unsuccessfully, I revisted the source code and look for poor programming practices that didn't initially jump out at me and then I found the ```eval()``` method. [^1] So in order to test my solution locally I did two things:

1. I created a [test harness](#testharness) based on the original [source code](#source).
2. Maintained a separate window with an interactive python session to test verify my inputs were valid python statements.

After having created these two testing windows I went to work trying to devise a way to take advantage of the ```eval()``` method. I found several resources online to include an blog by [Ned Batchelder](http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/201206/eval_really_is_dangerous.html), [Vipul Chaskar](http://vipulchaskar.blogspot.com/2012/10/exploiting-eval-function-in-python.html), and [floyd's IT Security](http://www.floyd.ch/?p=584). Which all of these blogs pointed out something very interesting. When ```eval()``` is used with the ```__import__```[^2] python  __\_\_builtin\_\___ module it can become very dangerous. For example, You can do something like this which would provide you all the local variables in the current namespace:


{% highlight python %}
eval("os.locals()")
{% endhighlight %}


## Solution
In order to beat this challenge first you had to pass the ```validation()``` function which contained a blacklist of invalid characters based on your input. The list is located on line

## Code Snippets

All code, solutions, and challenge materials are presented in this section in the case that anyone would like to try replicating our solution.

### <a name="source">Tokens.py Source code</a>

	for i in input:
		if ord(i) in nochrs:
			err = 1
			break
		else:
			err = 0
	if not err: return 1
	else: return 0

def gentoken(dic, seed, date):
	pt1 = pow(dic.values()[0], 2)
	pt2 = int(date[2:4]) * int(date[4:]) + ~int(date[:2])
	pt3 = [ord(x) for x in seed if ord(x) % 2 == 0] * 4
	pt3 = pt3[1] * pt3[3] * pt3[3] * pt3[7] + pt3[-1] + pt3[-3] + pt3[-3] + pt3[-7] + sum(pt3[13:37])
	return abs(pt1-(pt2+pt3))


if __name__ == '__main__':
	print "\nUsage:"
	print "gen 'token serial number'\n"

						now = datetime.now()
						date = "%02d%02d%02d" % (now.day, now.hour, now.minute)

## Endnotes

[^1]: ```eval()``` is a __\_\_builtin\_\___ module which allows a programmer to evaluate a python expression. It will also allow dynamic execution of arbitrary code objects such as ```compile()```, ```locals()```, and ```globals()```. Read more [here](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#eval).

[^2]: ```import()``` is a __\_\_builtin\_\___ module which according to the [pydocs](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#__import__) is not needed for everyday Python programming. It is invoked by the import statement and is usually only used in cases where you only know the name of a given module at runtime. What this also means is that we can potentially import any module we want from a CTF perspective - unless it is [specifically left out](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1350466/preventing-python-code-from-importing-certain-modules) or through [sandboxing](https://wiki.python.org/moin/SandboxedPython).
