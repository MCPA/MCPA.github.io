This is a solution guide to the Natas4 Level at [overthewire](http://natas4.natas.labs.overthewire.org). This write-up was created on 5 March 2015.

First connect to the website
<ul><li>http://natas4.natas.labs.overthewire.org</li>
<li>Enter the following as the username natas4 and password Z9tkRkWmpt9Qr7XrR5jWRkgOU901swEZ</li></ul>

Something new this time! This time when we visit the challenge page we get the following: 

<code>
Access disallowed. You are visiting from "" while authorized users should come only from (http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/
</code>

Ok, well I check the source code anyways, and nothing is really there. However, it does keep track of where I have already been when I visit the page. For example, when I refresh the page it says:

<code>
Access disallowed. You are visiting from "http://natas4.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php?url=http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/" while authorized users should come only from "http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/"</code>

It just so happens that since I'm using Chrome I can use my handy dandy referrer editor. For example I changed my referrer url to "i am awesome" and it resulted in the following:

<code>
Access disallowed. You are visiting from "i am awesome" while authorized users should come only from "http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/"</code>


Ok so enough playing around, let's put the correct address in! Which gives us:

<code>
Access granted. The password for natas5 is iX6IOfmpN7AYOQGPwtn3fXpbaJVJcHfq </code>

Goal! Let's move on, <code>natas5:iX6IOfmpN7AYOQGPwtn3fXpbaJVJcHfq</code>
