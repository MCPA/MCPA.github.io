This is a solution guide to the Natas0 Level at <a href="http://natas0.natas.labs.overthewire.org">overthewire</a>. This write-up was created on 5 March 2015.

First connect to the website
<ul><li>http://natas0.natas.labs.overthewire.org</li>
<li>Enter the following as the username natas0 and password narnia0</li></ul>

So this one seems pretty easy, it says the password is on this page. However it is not visible on the page itself. So my next step is to check the source code for the page.

The password is <code>natas1:gtVrDuiDfck831PqWsLEZy5gyDz1clto</code>

There's our password at the bottom of the page!
