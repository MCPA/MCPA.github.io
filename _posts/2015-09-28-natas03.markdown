This is a solution guide to the Natas3 Level at <a href="http://natas3.natas.labs.overthewire.org">overthewire</a>. This write-up was created on 5 March 2015.

First connect to the website
<ul><li>http://natas3.natas.labs.overthewire.org</li>
<li>Enter the following as the username natas3 and password sJIJNW6ucpu6HPZ1ZAchaDtwd7oGrD14</li></ul>

Once again we are presented with a page that says there is nothing. As before I first start by checking the source of the webpage and find this peculiar comment.

{% highlight html linenos %}
<div id="content">
There is nothing on this page
<!-- No more information leaks!! Not even Google will find it this time... -->
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

So that makes me start thinking about search engines. In a nutshell the robots.txt file on a webpage tells search engines which directories not to enter. More information about the robots.txt file can be found @ <a href = "http://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html">here</a>.

Now my first step is to check that file by visiting http://natas3.natas.labs.overthewire.org/robots.txt At this point I am presented with the robots.txt file which contains:

<code>User-agent: *
Disallow: /s3cr3t/</code>

This seems like an interesting place to visit, so let's change our url again: http://natas3.natas.labs.overthewire.org/s3cr3t/

Another users.txt file! When we read it we find ...
<code>natas4:Z9tkRkWmpt9Qr7XrR5jWRkgOU901swEZ</code>

Bingo!
