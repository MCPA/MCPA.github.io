<strong>Description:</strong> Crypto5 is a 500 point challenge that was presented during [HackIM](https://ctf.nullcon.net/) in Jan 2016. The challenge presents a file that is encrypted with a RSA-Private key. Fortunately, we are provided a group of 49 public keys and one of them is the corresponding key for the private key ...

## Introduction

The Crypto5 challenge requires us to parse out public keys from a file ```all_keys.txt```, which contains 49 different public keys. We are also given an encrypted file ```warrior.txt```, which has information in it about the fighter described in the problem. We are fortunate enought to know that the corresponding public key <strong>IS</strong> included inside the 49 keys.

## Solving the Problem

The first problem we have to solve is parsing out each one of the keys inside the file. We can see that each public key is formatted with a header, text in the middle, and a footer.

### Parsing the public keys

So first, I opened ```all_keys.txt``` in read-only mode. Next, I read the entire contents of ```all_keys.txt```. Last, I used <em>split()</em> to separate each line using the carriage return as the delimiter. Then <em>split()</em>'s list is stored inside a variable so that I can operate on it later.

Since I know that each public key is 9 lines long, I can create a quick <em>for</em> loop that will put the public keys back together from the list. I piece the public keys back together using a modulus of 9 and also re-insert the carriage returns I had removed with <em>split()</em>. Last, I write them to a separate file so I can use them for decoding and keep a ```file_list``` of each file that I create.

### Decrypting or encrypting the ciphertext

Now that I have the public keys separated out I can try using each key against the encrypted text file ```warrior.txt```. Since I saved the name of each file I created inside a list, I can now iterate over that list without having to reach out into the current directory.

I do this by iterating over each item in the ```file_list``` I created. I open each public key, read the contents, and then import the contents as an RSA key using ```RSA.importKey()```.[^3] Next, I can <strong>encrypt</strong> the ciphertext and retrieve the plaintext results. I don't want to read through 49 different results and manually search for the valid plaintext.

As a result, I found a useful python module called ```re```. ```re``` contains methods which allow me to conduct searches based on regular expressions. I could then add a quick ```boolean if``` statement to validate whether or not the plaintext contained some common trigraphs and text I expected to be in the plaintext, such as fighter or warrior. ```re.search```[^1] checked six different matches while ignoring the case [^2] and if it found any matches it printed the results.

## SCORE!

Originally, I tried to input several variations of Su-35 'Flanker' jet plane, but after a quick Google search of Su-35 Sukhoi KnAAPO, I found the correct format for the flag.

## Endnotes

[^1]: <strong>```re.search(pattern, string, flags=0)```</strong> Scan through string looking for the first location where the regular expression pattern produces a match, and return a corresponding MatchObject instance. Return None if no position in the string matches the pattern; note that this is different from finding a zero-length match at some point in the string.

[^2]: <strong>```re.I```</strong> Perform case-insensitive matching; expressions like [A-Z] will match lowercase letters, too. This is not affected by the current locale.

[^3]: There is an RSA module which allows you to directly use the methods of an RSA key object. More can be found on this module [here](https://pythonhosted.org/pycrypto/Crypto.PublicKey.RSA-module.html)
